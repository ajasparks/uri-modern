# URI Modern #

URI Modern is a WordPress theme designed for the University of Rhode Island. It's designed to replace all themes currently being used on the university's websites, and unify the online brand and experience. 

URI Modern is a mobile-first design, built to embrace the latest web technologies and strictest accessibility standards. Our approach can be summarized by four guiding principles. We want to:

* Design a clean, beautiful interface that elevates content
* Be responsive and accessible
* Use clean, modern, and efficient code
* Avoid business logic

By design, URI Modern is a theme, and *only* a theme.  This means that changing from this theme to another should change the look and feel of the website, but not impact its functionality.  Moving business logic out of the theme is a key developmental goal of this project, and will simplify maintenance and development of the website going forward.
