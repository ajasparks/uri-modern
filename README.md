# URI Modern

URI Modern is a WordPress theme designed for the University of Rhode Island. It's designed to replace all themes currently being used on the university's websites, and unify the online brand and experience. 

## Guiding Principles

URI Modern is a mobile-first design, built to embrace the latest web technologies and strictest accessibility standards. Our approach can be summarized by four guiding principles. We want to:

1. Design a clean, beautiful interface that elevates content
2. Be responsive and accessible
3. Use clean, modern, and efficient code
4. Avoid business logic

Built into each of these principles is the goal of being future-proof.  By building a theme with a lean, modern architecture that leverages as much native WordPress functionality as possible, we can reduce maintenance and avoid pitfalls as WordPress inevitably grows and changes.

Finally, as noted by the fourth guiding principle, it's important to emphasize that URI Modern is, by design, a theme, and *only* a theme.  This means that changing from this theme to another should change the look and feel of the website, but not impact its functionality.  Moving business logic out of the theme is a key developmental goal of this project, and will simplify maintenance and development of the website going forward.  To that end, many of the other URI Web repositories are plugins that add functionality outside the display layer.

## How do I get set up?

1. Install into your WordPress wp-content/themes directory
2. Activate it as your site's theme
3. Configure it with Customizer
