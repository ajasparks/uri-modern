# URI Modern

URI Modern is a WordPress theme designed for the University of Rhode Island. It's designed to replace all themes currently being used on the university's websites, and unify the online brand and experience.

## What's new in 1.2.9

URI Modern 1.2.9 is a bug fix release.

* Adds style customizations for [URI Component Library](https://github.com/uriweb/uri-component-library) panels formatted as "super"
* Reconfigures how beta features are accessed (no longer requires editing `wp-config.php`)
* Introduces accessibility and code error checking as a beta feature (availability based on user role)
* Updates devDependencies
