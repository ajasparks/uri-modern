# URI Modern

URI Modern is a WordPress theme designed for the University of Rhode Island. It's designed to replace all themes currently being used on the university's websites, and unify the online brand and experience.

## What's new in 2.0.0

URI Modern 2.0.0 is a major release focused on style refinements and improving core functionality.

### A Refined Look

The [URI Component Library](https://github.com/uriweb/uri-component-library) v4.0 and later relies on themes to control the look and feel of components beyond the general styles provided out-of-the-box.  URI Modern introduces a refined look for components, as well as other widely-used elements of the theme.

* Introduces a refined look for several components &mdash; most notably cards, buttons, and tabs
* Introduces a refined look for site menus and brand bar elements
* Adds styles for definition lists

### General Improvements

* Improves theme support for the Gutenberg block editor, including previewing theme fonts, background colors, and page title visibility
* Improves responsiveness of certain oEmbed elements
* Adds a `button-list` CSS class for styling vertical groups of buttons
* Removes accessibility and code error checking (install the [URI Code Compliance](https://github.com/uriweb/uri-code-compliance) plugin instead)
* Fixes an issue in breadcrumbs that caused the current post to not be included
* Other bug fixes
* Updates devDependencies
